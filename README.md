# JHipster Operator

![](jhipster-operator-logo.png)

This operator simplifies the way how user can deploy their JHipster applications
to Kubernetes. It comes with a few CRDs and makes abstracts the deployment of different
components, such as Databases, Service Discovery / Config servers from the user

## Architecture

![](architecture.png)

The operator comes with two CRDS: `JHipsterSetup` and `JHipsterApplication`.
The setup holds configuration which is common for all applications, while the application always refer to one certain
JHipster application. These are the main ideas of this operator:

1. bring down the YAML the user deploys to a minimum set of fields, targeting specific configuration of an application
   1. removes requirement to deploy consul/eureka/databases
   2. removes to know the exact environment variable name for options
2. making stuff like database management more flexible by either taking control of DB deployment or giving it the user
3. plug the setup to other options of JHister, such as monitoring, control center etc
4. still allow to override all K8S native fields using the `overide` attributes



## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/jhipster-operator:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/jhipster-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
